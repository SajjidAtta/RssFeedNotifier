You will enjoy working with us if you like to figure things out and can work with minimal guidance. Ability to communicate well will be the key (mostly written communication -- to do code reviews, discuss design ideas on the slack channel). You shall be amazing at your current domain and shall be willing to learn new tech (we will provide paid time to learn) as needed. <br /><br />
The work will involve,<br />
a) Java development on our web services stack. In particular SpringBoot.<br />
b) Use backend databases -- Oracle, MySQL, elastic search, Druid<br />
c) Dockerization/Cloud deployment of applications, experience working with Linux, Amazon EC2<br />
d) JUnit tests, JMeter tests of the stack. Git pull-request workflow.<br />
e) Optional -- Front-end development using Angular6 (TypeScript) or React or JS in general<br />
f) Ability to go through thousands of lines of code and quickly pick up a new domain is a solid plus<br />
g) Code quality tools like SonarQube<br /><br />
If you have front-end experience (Angular, React, TypeScript) please call that out. <br /><br />
To start, your main focus will be to improve the code quality and JUnit coverage of a backend system that has over 500k lines of code. This will require you to figure out literally thousands of lines of code and understand how it works with minimal guidance. <br /><br />
After this initial task, you will be engaged in adding enhancements, work on the new products/projects etc.<br /><br />
If this sounds interesting, please write to us about your technology experience, please tell us about a couple of key projects you did.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />
Please provide your linked-in public profile. Tell us if you are active on blogs Or if you are an active contributor to stack-overflow? <br /><br />
Please mention how much time per day/week you can allocate us. What will be your working hours (in ET NYC time zone). And when can you start.<br /><br />
Please note that after a few test tasks, if we decide to work long-term, you need to go through background checks with upwork enterprise.<br /><br />
When you apply please put the following line somewhere at the beginning <br /><br />

We develop apps rapidly with minimal specification documents and diagrams at the beginning. But good technical and user documentation needs to follow!<br /><br />
We&#039;re looking for a freelancer to work with on an ongoing basis to produce user and technical documentation for our clients&#039; apps. The work will be intensive at first, since we have several large projects that need documentation now, and then less intense but steady for years to come.<br /><br />
Our applications are commercial, not scientific, so they&#039;re not highly technical, and most apps and processes are of medium complexity.<br /><br />
Skills:<br />
* Very good ability to write two kinds of documentation: user documentation for non-technical business users and technical documentation to support troubleshooting and future development<br />
* Skill at illustrating complex processes and relationships visually with diagrams, flowcharts, etc.<br />
* Ability to interview and/or work along with business users and developers to come to a thorough understanding of clients&#039; business processes and how our apps are built and used<br /><br />
Other Qualifications:<br />
* Relevant technical writing and graphic design experience<br />
* Some knowledge of management information systems or databases<br />
* Some familiarity with computer programming languages, particularly javascript<br />
* Not afraid to dig into database apps to understand how they work or wade through code to comprehend what it&#039;s doing<br />
* Professional communications skills and personal bearing<br />
* Reliable and responsive<br />
* Maintains confidentiality<br /><br />
Important Additional Notes:<br />
* Only proposals submitted through Upwork will be considered. All attempts to contact anyone at the company by phone, e-mail, or LinkedIn will be rejected.<br />

4. Ability to deal with real time requests arising from process hungry large scale applications. (Reddis, RabbitMQ are a plus)<br />

Create a central database system to store information about books.<br />
The system will need the following features:<br />
&bull;	accessible to remote users (using both Windows and MacOS)<br />
&bull;	records added via a csv import or web form (both user and guest)<br />
&bull;	produce reports (on-screen and csv download) based on filterable criteria<br />
&bull;	enable metadata to be stored in multiple languages<br />
&bull;	make it easy to update multiple records from one screen<br /><br />
Current size of data:<br />
Number of books: 5,500<br />
Number of users: 3 (all admin users)<br /><br />
Scalability: <br />
Potential number of books: 20,000+<br />
Potential number of users: 1,000+ (if access was given to clients, who may &lsquo;own&rsquo; from 1 to 500+ books)<br /><br />
Platform and hosting preference:<br />
No preference. <br />
Currently we collect and store data via our Wordpress-based website. The new database does NOT necessarily need to integrate with this.<br />
However, reliable uptime and response time is mission crucial as the information will be accessed many times each day.<br />
Automated back-ups should be taken at least once per day with a straightforward restore feature.<br />
Our website is hosted with WP Engine, if you recommend a Wordpress-based solution would need to compatible with the features offered by this host.<br /><br />

Sqlite4java is built with the purpose to provide high-performance, low-garbage interface to SQLite for desktop Java applications. The library is located at https://bitbucket.org/almworks/sqlite4java.<br /><br />
The library was originally built at ALM Works to support products like Deskzilla and Jira Client. As the active development of those products subsided, sqlite4java got less and less attention. However, it started to be used by other projects around the world, in particular, on mobile / IoT platforms and low-power processors.<br /><br />
At this time, we&#039;re looking for an experienced software engineer who would take care of the library on a task-by-task basis. The following are the tasks that we&#039;re looking to address:<br />
- Upgrading embedded SQLite version to the latest and greatest.<br />
- Addressing issues filed by the users on the Bitbucket&#039;s issue system.<br />
- Refactoring build&#039;s environment and make the library build with Maven.<br />
- Reviewing new features of SQLite and adding support for those to the wrapper.<br /><br />
Requirements:<br />
- Excellent knowledge of Java and C programming languages<br />
- Knowledge of JNI<br />
- Experience with different platforms<br />
- Experience with Android is a plus<br />
- Experience with ARM processors is a plus<br />
- Example code demonstrating good design and coding practices is required.<br /><br />
The Process:<br />
We will discuss the scope, split it into tasks and do the estimation per task. You will be submitting pull requests, while which will be reviewed by a senior developer at ALM Works. You will get comments, suggestions and other feedback, and you&#039;ll need to address all the feedback before the pull request is accepted.<br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: August 17, 2018 21:26 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Web, Mobile &amp; Software Dev &gt; Other - Software Development

At this time, we&#039;re looking for an experienced software engineer who would take care of the library on a task-by-task basis. The following are the tasks that we&#039;re looking to address:<br />
- Upgrading embedded SQLite version to the latest and greatest.<br />
- Addressing issues filed by the users on the Bitbucket&#039;s issue system.<br />
- Refactoring build&#039;s environment and make the library build with Maven.<br />
- Reviewing new features of SQLite and adding support for those to the wrapper.<br /><br />
Requirements:<br />
- Excellent knowledge of Java and C programming languages<br />
- Knowledge of JNI<br />
- Experience with different platforms<br />
- Experience with Android is a plus<br />
- Experience with ARM processors is a plus<br />
- Example code demonstrating good design and coding practices is required.<br /><br />
The Process:<br />
We will discuss the scope, split it into tasks and do the estimation per task. You will be submitting pull requests, while which will be reviewed by a senior developer at ALM Works. You will get comments, suggestions and other feedback, and you&#039;ll need to address all the feedback before the pull request is accepted.<br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: August 17, 2018 21:26 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Web, Mobile &amp; Software Dev &gt; Other - Software Development

Programing Quote A<br />
&bull;	Camera that can:<br />
o	Travel around a room, FPV style<br />
o	Can snap to predetermined points<br />
o	Can switch to an isometric zoomed out view, hide the &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; and navigate around the view in a user controlled orbit<br />

&bull;	UI Database:<br />
o	that can pull up a list of modular assets (tables chairs, shelves etc).<br />
o	can filter by type (furniture, utilities, etc).<br />
&bull;	Drag and drop assets onto a room layout.<br />
&bull;	Can rotate assets in 90 degree increments.<br />
&bull;	Save/Load layouts.<br />
Programing Quote C<br />
&bull;	Can hide/unhide walls to reveal power lines/ gas lines/ outlets/ etc.<br />
&bull;	Can evaluate when assets are within a door opening radius.<br />
&bull;	Can evaluate when specific assets that, for example are electrical, are too far away from an outlet.<br />
