    <title>Looking for strong Nodejs/API and Angular5x  Developers â€“ Agency Preferred - Upwork</title>
    <description>We are looking to establish a long term relationship with an Upwork Agency and hire 1-2 members as dedicated resources. We do not require a Project Manager for day to day activities and are happy to communicate directly with the developers, however we would like to know there is a manager available for escalations and oversight. We would ask that a standard start time be maintained so we can schedule some overlap (we prefer morning hours of CST timezone) to review work and discuss tasks.
**Your Responsibilities Will Include:
-	development, migration and updates to a large content management system that manages a lot of retail and mall content
-	work collaboratively in Slack together as a group. Your team will interface with myself, our project managers, and our development team on a regular basis and the ability to quickly respond in chat is very important
-	have regular starting hours with some overlap of CST timezone and consistently starting work at that time
-	tracking your time per task with notes for our records
Our goal is that you will be a part of our team and we will work together on this cool platform and others for months and years to come.
** About the CMS System:
You will be working purely on the data side of the CMS and not the front-end website. We inject data from a few sources, we expose APIs and webservices to other systems which consume our data either for processing or sending to the other system which manages the actual website and mobile application. We have about 2 months of work in our backlog and we would like to bring on skilled professionals to work with us on getting this stuff done. As part of the onboarding and development we will be working on documentation and diagramming the system. We feel that having new developers work on this will also help them learn the system and how it works so that when they develop on it, it will make sense to them.
** Technologies You Should be Familiar With:
We have put together a list of specific skills that would be involved in our application and for the new team members to be responsible for. It&amp;#039;s not critical that you are 100% experts at all the areas listed below but you need to be proficient in larger applications built in a MEAN stack which utilize a lot of AWS services.

    <title>Developer needed to create node based sync utility for (SFDC) Salesforce Dot Com. - Upwork</title>
    <description>Summary: 
We need to execute an SFDC batch job, download the results, and log them to the console. We will use 2 NodeJS scripts. The first script (Invoker) will initiate the SFDC batch job to query all accounts in the SFDC instance that have a specific custom field set. The second script (Downloader) will check if the batch job succeeded, and if it did, download the results and log them to the console.
Requirements:
&amp;bull;	The NodeJS scripts should use ES 2017, Babel and Node version 8.11.4. 
&amp;bull;	The scripts should assume that they will log in as an SFDC user with access to the SFDC instance. 
&amp;bull;	The username, password, and SFDC instance should be parameters in the function being called.
&amp;bull;	The field the Invoker will use for filtering should be a parameter on the function.
Link to video that shows the process of running a batch job in SF
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19gjo1tQLkG5JbCP_aLM207M1Jepiby5h?usp=sharing
From what is described in the video link above, we are basically looking to turn that into a scriptable process via node.
We already have a code baseline to start from. The baseline code is a complete compilable node project with linting/babel already setup ready to go.
We have a repo to work from ready to go see attached screen shoots of baseline project.Budget: $300

    <title>Male Mandarin voice talent -30 - 40 lessons.  Each lesson approx. 1500 words. - Upwork</title>
    <description>Hello, we are rolling out 30 to 40 lessons, which are approximately 1500-1600 words over the next three to five months. These will be in batches of 10 lessons at a time for the same male Mandarin talent to record. We will use the same voice for all 30 to 40 lessons.
The main priority is pacing and delivery of the script. Since there are technical terms in the lessons, its important to have subtle and purposeful pauses throughout in order for the listener to digest/ grasp the information.
The tonality of the voice is to be a blend of conversational and informative and educational. Not too dull, dry and robotic. Not guy next store delivery the whole time. Moderate inflection with a smooth fluid delivery. Personable yet intelligent.
Pay will be $150 for each lesson and if the lesson goes over 2000 words (which if it were to go over it would not be by very much ) I will pay $250. Ideal delivery time for the 10 lessons would be about 10 to 14 days, but I have some leeway if its needed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As i&amp;#039;m sure you&amp;#039;ve all experienced, &amp;amp;quot;the sooner the better&amp;amp;quot;.
Requirements to be a candidate:
1). Provide a sample or two from the script attached. Feel free to provide different deliveries if you wish (not trying to make more work for you but want everyone to have a fair shot)
2) Be available over the next couple months for all of the lessons
3) Have a home studio that you&amp;#039;re able to deliver with high quality
4) Willing to discuss delivery time to meet time requirements. I would say approximately 10-14 days would be a solid window.
I appreciate and respect your willingness to audition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;m not asking you to record the whole document, just a two or three sections to showcase tonality, pacing, delivery.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Thank you -- Mark
PS - the short script doesn&amp;#039;t seem to come out in the format that allows you to see the spaces between the paragraphs. Use your discernment and feel free to include ample pausesBudget: $6,000

    <description>Hi!
I have a list of URLs in Excel. About 1000 of them 
Need to count certain keywords on these pages.
Output should Ideally post back to excel cell next to the URL, but can just write a web page where I post a list of URLs and and a phrase and script generates a table with keyword count in front of each URL. In this case web hosting will be on Amazon EC2 Windows Server. Which ever option is faster to load.
Required features
- count of individual key words (each one separately)
- check if all these words are within a certain range of words (say 50, ~ a paragraph apart)
- count full phrase verbatim
- check if the page exists behind the URL
Number of URLs&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to be processed per batch ~1000
Please provide with your answer
- your full fee including debugging and Q&amp;amp;amp;A
- time for completion
- experience in similar tasks
- resume with qualificationsPosted On: September 12, 2018 12:22 UTCCategory: Web, Mobile &amp;amp; Software Dev &amp;gt; Web Development

    <title>Need a Powershell expert who can create PS scripts in batch file to automate Dynamics CRM 2011 to Dynamics CRM 2016 Upgrade tasks - Upwork</title>
    <description>This runs like a well oiled machine for us. We get these customer databases and we do the same thing every time. No errors, nothing. But it takes 10 hours. 
We have the list of steps. This is for our own environment,
At a very high level these are the tasks:
1. Restore the Client database to a server with Pre-installed CRM 2011
2. Run a sql script to clean the db
3. Import the Organization
4. Back up the DB
5. Run another SQL script
6. Back up the CRM 2013 upgraded DB
7. Restore to another server with CRM 2015 installed already
8. Import Org
9. Run a script
10. Back up the db
11. Restore to another CRM 2016 already installed
12. Import Org
Run another SQL script.
Done.
When we do this on client servers, there are some variations.
For every new installation or deployment of software, we have to do many system checks and verifications on their Windows Servers
Lets define the scope of work. 
Do the low hanging fruits first. 
Lets make it a phased approach. 
Automation of these frequently repetitive tasks with every client will save us a lot of time in deployments and will make us more productive. I have been working on some of these on my own but a powershell expert would be good to work with.

    <title>Need a Powershell expert who can create PS scripts in batch file to automate Pre-install tasks - Upwork</title>
    <description>You could do this in phased approach as well. Your PS scripts should be able to do these:
For every new installation or deployment of software, we have to do many system checks and verifications on Windows Servers which we connect remotely via vpn connections. 
Typically Windows Server 2012 R2 and above. Some are virtualized as well. SQL 2014 and above. 
1. Get CPU, RAM, Drives, available memory on each drive
2. Server manager - Add/Remove Roles and Features. 
a) Check whether, .NET Framework 4.5, IIS and bunch of other Server components and Windows Server Features are installed
3. Registry Verifications and modify registry entries and values if needed
4. Run SQL commands from command prompt
Also minor things like these Remote desktop connections will go back to screen saver mode and I have to enter password every time to go back in. 
while I am working on Application Server, I want to keep RDP sessions of other Servers open so I can go back in and out without having to enter password every time.
We access these RDPs via Jump servers. Same for Jump servers. 
Also don&amp;#039;t want our PCs to go back to screen saver mode so I have to enter password to get back in to check the progress on how the installs on RDP sessions are coming along.

    <title>Civil Maps is Hiring for freelance consultant - DevOps Engineer - Upwork</title>
    <description>Hi ,
We are Civil Maps .
Civil Maps, provider of 3D mapping technology for fully autonomous vehicles, has raised a $6.6 million seed funding round from Ford Motor Company, Motus Ventures, Wicklow Capital, StartX Stanford and Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang&amp;rsquo;s AME Cloud Ventures.
Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; mission is to make it possible for fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Levels 4-5) to drive anywhere smoothly and safely. Through artificial intelligence and vehicle-based local processing, Civil Maps converts sensor data into meaningful map information built specifically to direct fully autonomous vehicles. The company will use the seed investment to accelerate product development and deployment with a number of leading automotive companies and technology partners.
Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; artificial intelligence software aggregates raw 3D data from LiDAR (high-resolution laser imaging), camera and other sensors onboard autonomous vehicles and organizes the information into machine-readable maps. The information is vastly more actionable information than today&amp;rsquo;s mapping systems and requires a fraction of the data storage and transmission for existing technologies. Thanks to this light data footprint, Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; spatial information is far less costly to transmit over cellular networks, enabling the company to more easily crowdsource, update and share road data in real time&amp;mdash;a major improvement over the lengthy processes that require human annotation in current use. As a result, the company can quickly generate and maintain maps that give fully autonomous vehicles the comprehensive and precise knowledge to autonomous operate safely and smoothly on all roads.
About the Opportunity : 
This is an opportunity to work on some of the most exciting problems in the autonomous vehicle industry. Civil Maps is looking for a Devops engineer to grow its overall infrastructure. You will be interacting with a completely custom-made distributed computing framework, handling terabytes and petabytes of machine vision data, and millions of requests from robotic platforms.
In our interdisciplinary teams, you will get acquainted with the many facets of 3D map creation: data collection, geospatial registration, feature extraction, auditing.
Come work on novel challenges, learn and grow while helping Civil Maps achieve on-demand perception of the world around us.

    <title>British / Australian / S. Africa Voiceover Training Videos - Upwork</title>
    <description>I need to create voice over videos for our training classes.
The goal is to make extremely dry, boring content at least sound good.
I will provide Powerpoint file and script by page.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each Powerpoint is approx 10 pages and the script averages about 1000 words.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I need the video output in a video format (MP4)-- basically PP file with voice over.
The first client has approx 60 videos.
The first batch, which we would consider a test would be 6 videos-- each about 1000 words. 
Assuming this first batch goes well, we will send remaining 54 videos.
I may be willing to pay extra for video of speaking along with PP (As I have heard retention is better when watching people speak).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is obviously dependent on &amp;#039;look&amp;#039;.Budget: $125
