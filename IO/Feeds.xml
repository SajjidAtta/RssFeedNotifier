    <description>*** Hiring THIS week ***
I created a video for this job.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&amp;#039;s 5 minutes. 
PASSWORD: upwork
https://vimeo.com/296143811
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Google Chrome Extension that works with Facebook Api + Google Sheets
Features:
1) Pull from facebook group questions and answers
2) Extract information into google sheet + create another column where only first names are extracted
3) Auto-adds facebook group requests to join
Answers from questions I got so far:
1) Is data automatically pushed to google sheet?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On chrome extension dashboard (open tab), there is a button that says &amp;amp;quot;push data to sheet&amp;amp;quot; and you choose which google sheet you want to push data to. **Screenshot attached**
2) Is there more than 1 group or only work with 1 group?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The chrome extension works with more than 1 facebook group and can push data to more than 1 google sheet. **Screenshot attached**
3) Is there a facebook app involved where it has to be connected with an app?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Currently I do not see it needs to be connected with any facebook app but it does need to communicate with facebook somehow as I see the google sheet link is within facebook group Settings dashboard.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**screenshot attached**
4) How do I connect to facebook with google chrome extension?
Looks like they did it by the google sheet URL. **screenshot attached**
5) What is the workflow of a user look like? From a similar chrome extension point of view?
1) Group funnels is purchased with an email2
2) Extension downloaded
3) Someone on the backend (worker at groupfunnels) MANUALLY connects something to your email address so you are approved to use groupfunnels
4) Create blank google sheet --&amp;amp;gt; upload their CSV file into google sheet to match format of facebook
5) After chrome extension is downloaded... go into Facebook Group Settings... there will be a BLANK bar.
6) Copy and paste URL of google sheet (share link) into the blank bar within Facebook Group dashboard where you approve members
7) Click &amp;amp;quot;approve all&amp;amp;quot; and data is transported into Group Funnels Dashboard (another tab in browser)
8) Data is shown within Group Funnels Dashboard like an excel sheet format --&amp;amp;gt; we choose from a drop down which Google Sheet to push data into. --&amp;amp;gt; then we push a button that pushes data into correct google sheet.
9) There is another button where we can &amp;amp;quot;Clear data&amp;amp;quot; so that we do not end up pushing same data twice into same google sheet (causing repeat data)
I created a video for it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&amp;#039;s 5 minutes.

    <link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/List-building-Google-document-looking-emails-just-data-entry_%7E0105e103917e0ec597?source=rss</link>
    <description>This job consists of building a list of accredited healthcare education programs in the United States. All of the information required - University, first name, last name, address, degree, accreditation expiration date - is publicly available. All you need to do is extract this data and enter it into a Google spreadsheet that we will provide. This is basically a copying and pasting list building project.
To start, you will simply enter all the schools described in the &amp;amp;quot;CAPTE&amp;amp;quot; section of the attached document - these schools are members of the American Physical Therapy Association. There&amp;#039;s probably a few hundred schools on this list, and that&amp;#039;s where you&amp;#039;ll start. If you do a good job on this initial part of the project (we&amp;#039;ll check your work), then we have an almost endless supply of additional work for you.Budget: $100

I need a very experienced PHP developer that is great with SQL.
The task is to extract all of a users orders from the dbase and put them into a list.
when the item in the list is clicked, it needs to open in details view to look like an invoice, with a generate PDF option.
The pdfdoc class is already present in the system, so you can hook into it.

    <title>Data Scraping required on Property Portals for Marketing Campaigns - Upwork</title>
    <link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Data-Scraping-required-Property-Portals-for-Marketing-Campaigns_%7E01b9a7e01d13bb6067?source=rss</link>
    <description>Our goal is to find the addresses of certain properties that are for sale on UK property portals. We want the data to be from specific postcodes and extracted on a monthly basis. 
We are looking for properties that meet any of the following criteria:
- Have been reduced in price
- On the portal for over 6 months
- On the portal with multiple agents
- Have the least number of views
- Contain keywords in the description such as &amp;#039;investor&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;no-chain&amp;#039; (A keyword list will be provided)
The addresses will then be entered into a spreadsheet which we will check over and upload to a mailing website - from where we can send out tailored marketing to these addresses encouraging them to sell their property via us. A flowchart is attached to show the process more clearly (with your part being green).
The portals will be Rightmove and Zoopla, however, they do not put information regarding the property number which is essential. We know how to find this information manually although it requires various websites/searches/checks - if there is a way to automate we&amp;#039;re open to suggestions.
We know how to do all of this manually, but we&amp;#039;d like to automate it and we lack the knowledge to do it ourselves. At this point, we&amp;#039;re just interested to see if this is possible and if so, we&amp;#039;re looking for somebody to work with long-term, ideally with good English and can offer creative solutions.
Happy to chat this over for anyone interested! I know a lot is still to be figured out.Posted On: October 20, 2018 21:36 UTCCategory: Data Science &amp;amp; Analytics &amp;gt; Data Mining &amp;amp; Management

    <description>Technical Recruiter Job Description
The technical recruiter need not only to have the ability to realistically source, screen, and present qualified candidates, but the confidence to communicate unrealistic technical requirements goals to hiring managers. This is the technical recruiter&amp;rsquo;s profile description.
The areas of responsibilities/skills for the Technical Recruiter include:
Review. Successfully review job descriptions in to understand the needs of the hiring manager as well to ask questions that&amp;rsquo;ll help you identify the right candidate(s). This is by far the most important skill a technical recruiter needs.
Understand technology, technical roles and technical skills. Learn and evaluate your technical skills
Identify. Sourcing and uncovering candidates
Screen. Ascertaining the competence of candidates against a technical job description
Interview. Meeting candidates in person, telephone, or video conference etc to assess their qualifications
Following up. Keep your candidates in the loop. This goes a long way to build your credibility and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;keep your candidates either coming back to you or sending referrals to you. Read my article on following up with candidates and also why candidates are rude to their recruiters
Present. Showing or offering candidate resume to hiring managers to scrutinize or consider
The end result needs to be the presentation of employ-able and qualified candidates for technical positions in various industries and for job roles such as in software development, systems administration, database, architecture, business processes etc.
To carry out these tasks the technical recruiter needs the following skills:
Technology knowledge &amp;ndash; Ability to understand technology and to keep abreast of technology trends at client company. See more on technology knowledge
Confidence &amp;ndash; The ability to be comfortable in who one is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the know it, learn it and do not try to fake it. It may be off-putting to your candidate when you try to fake technical knowledge.
Maturity &amp;ndash; Recruiter level needs to equal or above that of the candidate ( an example is a new recruiter with about 6 months experience trying to recruit a Director of IT). That being said, nothing is impossible. Technical knowledge, confidence, and maturity make up for the lack of specific recruiter experience.
Inquisitiveness &amp;ndash; Being able to ask questions of your sales/account managers (agency recruiters), clients (hiring managers) and your candidates
Relationship Building &amp;ndash; Start every conversation with the intent to build, develop and maintain relationships with your candidates.
For effectiveness the IT Recruiter should:
Continue in a area of strength: An individual technical recruiter may work best when recruiting efforts are focused on job titles in similar levels and expertise. For instance a technical recruiter who is comfortable with recruiting system administrators, desktop support engineers and other job roles in similar categories may not be as effective if required to recruit at higher (lower) levels and job roles &amp;ndash; this is often a requirement in technical recruiter job descriptions. Patience becomes a great virtue for a recruiter who after working with software developers for a number of years is now required to recruit desktop support engineers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is in no way disparaging either the recruiter or the candidate but only to highlight the fact that recruiters, just like any other working professional have areas of strength that should be harnessed.
It takes time to learn and understand the lingo and requirements of different technical job roles in order to become effectual.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A technical recruiter familiar with candidates at a certain level may require meaningful on-the-job-training time to gain the confidence required to start recruiting senior level IT professionals. The expectation that recruiters should be able to recruit candidates at all levels of IT is a recipe for failure. Technical recruiters may attempt to recruit at all levels, but may not produce great results. Some recruiters are better suited in entry level jobs, others consulting, others business process systems, executive levels etc.
Duties :
Source, screen, interview, and evaluate candidates
Foster long-term relationships with candidates
Review and understand technical job requirement requirements
Review applicants to verify if position requirements are met
Format resumes 
Research new technologies
Create detailed job descriptions
Follow up with candidates
Requirements for Technical Recruiter
Ability to build strong relationships
Ability to learn technical information

    <description>I am a trainer and I want to use Sharepoint for collaboration with my students. Each training batch will have some students. And I should be able to collaborate with them. 
So I&amp;#039;m thinking of having some scripting done so that I input details of students, course timeline events, sub grouping details of students and script automatically creates training batch environment for collaboration with following specifications. 
0) Layout should be like this. 
	I) Main Training Batch Site Page -&amp;amp;gt; 
		a) Timeline on top, 
		b) then announcements only from me, 
		c) then 2 columns with left column for highlights of conversations of main site with stats of number of messages and number of files in document library and right column for highlights of conversations of sub-group site with stats of number of messages and number of files in that document library of 		sub group site. Highlights will also have last top 5 conversation titles. 
		d) then document library of files I shared with all students. 
		e) then document library of files shared by others with sorting of my approved from those files on top and unapproved files at the bottom. Here if files were shared 		within the sub group then they will not be visible here until I approve that file. Those shared files within sub group will 		only be visible to that sub group members and only in sub group section and page. 
	II) Sub Training Batch Site Collaboration Page (When clicked on right side column as mentioned in c) above -&amp;amp;gt; 
		a) Conversations on top and 
		b) document library at the bottom.
		This page will only be accessible by sub groups. Including the shared files. Shared files will only be visible outside the sub group page when I approve file, which will then be visible under Team Site Document Library where other&amp;#039;s shared files are shown.
	III) Main Training Batch Site Collaboration Page (When clicked on left side column as mentioned in c) above -&amp;amp;gt;
		a) Conversation on top and
		b) document library at the bottom. Both my document library and student&amp;#039;s shared files document library.
		This page will be accessible by all from that training batch. Including shared files in document library. Document Library of my shared files as well as Document library of student&amp;#039;s shared files will be visible here same like on main training batch site page.
I&amp;#039;ll upload the scope file separately. The character limit here is not allowing to copy paste the scope content.
Go through it and provide your fixed price quote in AUD or INR and with accurate time estimate.
Note this work is about Microsoft Sharepoint custom design and scripting allowing me to create designed sharepoint sites, subsites and environment as per scope.
You must have done such work before.Budget: $500

    <description>Hi,
You are writing a file server based from my UDPClient and UDPServer files. The client connects to the server, requests a file and the server sends the file in 100 byte chunks to the client. The client writes the chunks into a file. Each chunk is wrapped in a header and trailer to make a packet.
You need to write a couple of classes first &amp;ndash; one that creates a packet &amp;ndash; see the diagram on the specification. It creates a string of ~105 bytes, made up of the things in the diagram. Get the 100 bytes of data from the file you are sending to the client., calculate the checksum (use a any algorithm which produces 1 byte of checksum &amp;ndash; your choice), add the checksum and trailer to the packet and send. You can have a method to create the packet, a method to extract the data and a method the calculate or verify the checksum. Both the server and the client will use this class.
You also need a class to implement error correction and provide RTD (v. 2.2 or 3). At the receiver (client): That means you have methods that set or check the sequence number (if it&amp;rsquo;s repeated, drop the packet and request the other sequence number[send a NACK]); if it&amp;rsquo;s expected, process (extract, write data to file) and request the next packet. Send an ACK (the ack character) if the expected sequence number is received and the checksum you calculate matches the one ion the trailer) or send a NACK character if you get either the wrong sequence number or if the checksum is wrong). At the server, if you receive an ACK, delete the old sent packet and create the next one (flipping the sequence number). If you get a NACK, send the packeket again. If you date to implement RTD3, you need to add a timer which re-sends the packet if the timer expires before receiving an ACK or NACK.
I have been provided a newBridge class that simulates packet and Ack loss when both noLoss=false AckLoss=false. The UDP server must send a file to the client and the client must receive all packets fully and without error.
My deadline is Friday 2:00pm AEDT.
Thanks,
AntonioBudget: $90

    <description>We are looking to build a custom AutoLISP tool that will automate the process of labeling items in our shop drawings and recording that information in an external database.
The tool will ideally be an interactive script which is capable of recording and retrieving multiple pieces of data from user input and from drawing elements selected by the user, recording that data in an external database, synthesizing data from the external database and user input, and creating MTEXT objects in the drawing.
Currently, the exact nature of the external database is unknown. In the long term, we expect to use an SQL or Access database, but at the moment CSV or XLS files might be a stopgap solution. We are eager to begin work on this project even before this uncertainty is settled.Posted On: October 20, 2018 21:36 UTCCategory: Engineering &amp;amp; Architecture &amp;gt; 3D Modeling &amp;amp; CAD

    <title>Python code to upload data from Excel to MS SQL (follow-up: build Django app) - Upwork</title>
    <link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Python-code-upload-data-from-Excel-SQL-follow-build-Django-app_%7E01fb77dead53fc50b6?source=rss</link>
    <description>**Caveats &amp;ndash; please read first**
1.	Although this project is narrowly focused around one task, what you build here will be part of a full-blown web application with which we&amp;#039;ll also need help. And we&amp;#039;d like to keep working with the same person or team all the way. For this reason, in addition to qualifications determined by this project, we need someone with demonstrated success developing Django apps working with MS SQL server on AWS. The app will be fairly basic, for internal use only, and we&amp;#039;ll make it as easy as possible to develop it, but nonetheless we need someone who did it before.
2.	Once deployed, this web app will be a mission-critical component of our business, and so, in a way, will be person who built it. For this reason, continuity is very important. Ideally, we&amp;#039;d prefer a team. An individual freelancer will be considered if he has at least 3 years&amp;#039; worth of consistent (full-time) experience and reasonable expectation of availability in the future (e.g. we don&amp;rsquo;t need a current student who will graduate and get a full-time job in 6 months).
**Specification**
We enter financial data into Excel (3-4 years&amp;#039; worth of quarterly data for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;~130 metrics for ~1000 companies) and need a script which will upload it to MS SQL DB. &amp;amp;quot;Metric&amp;amp;quot; refers to a financial metric such as revenue, total debt etc., a scalar value with 2 decimal places. Excel file has metrics in rows and quarters in columns. Quarters are strings (e.g. &amp;amp;quot;Sep&amp;#039;18&amp;amp;quot;) with no datetime characteristics and are not aligned for all companies (most companies report Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec, others can do Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct). DB is already built, with schema matching Excel sheets but transposed, i.e. DB has metrics in columns, and every quarter will be a row. You will be able to tweak DB schema and interface, if needed. DB will be on AWS.
The reason we need a custom script, as opposed to using off-the-shelf SQL functionality, is that we need to add some conflict-resolution logic. Roughly speaking, once the data is uploaded from Excel, every time we try to change it, this system, let&amp;#039;s call it &amp;amp;quot;bridge&amp;amp;quot;, should throw a warning and require the user to enter a comment as to why the change is made. Two examples help clarify this:
Normal scenario: company A reports quarterly financial results, we create a new *column* in Excel and manually type in about 20 metrics, and the bridge uploads this first batch. This creates a new *row* in DB with new unique ID (say ID 1). Usually within a week or so, the company files full report with ~130 metrics, and our data provider fills them in the same Excel book (fully populating the column which we manually created a week before). This is the second, and almost always, final, upload &amp;ndash; with initial 20 metrics potentially overwritten and new ~110 ones added. When this second batch gets pushed to DB, it creates a new row (say ID = 2), and row with ID1 gets deactivated (via a boolean field). Since time delta between row 2 and row 1 does not exceed threshold of say 10 days, the bridge simply pushes up the data without regard to existing values.
Exception scenario: while researching company B, we find out that it had made an acquisition 5 months ago, such that its financial condition is affected, so we need to adjust historical data for the company. In Excel, we change 10 metrics for each of the most recent and previous 4 quarters. Since time delta for at least one of target columns exceeds threshold, the bridge shows an error and requires the user to enter a comment. The bridge creates 5 new rows, deactivates 5 old ones (via boolean field) and adds user comment to the deactivated rows. Note that all conflicts pertaining to the same ticker within the same time period (all changes to Q1&amp;#039;18, for example), will be collapsed into one warning and comment.
The bridge works one way &amp;ndash; only upload.
If more information is needed, don&amp;#039;t hesitate to ask.
**Deliverables**
A Python class (compatible with 3.6), with complete docstrings and with full test coverage (pytest).Budget: $600

    <description>I would like to find someone who can create an overview of current software development tools and platforms for web-serviced cloud architectures.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
The person I am looking for will have solid understanding of (best case: experience with) tools like SPARC, Postman, Jenkins, hyperledger, kuberneties, Hadoop, apogee (and/or kong), etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I&amp;#039;d like to create an inventory of popular tools, describe what each are good for, create an ontology, and map them to contemporary software development flows.
This is as much for me as for potential clients.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It will be an interactive assignment (I could do this myself if I had time, but there are some tools I do not know).Posted On: October 20, 2018 21:36 UTCCategory: IT &amp;amp; Networking &amp;gt; Network &amp;amp; System Administration

    <title>Senior CI/CD DevOps Engineer - Upwork</title>
    <link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Senior-DevOps-Engineer_%7E0118e02080f29c19b5?source=rss</link>
    <description>Come be the engineer who leads us on the journey to best practice CI/CD engineering! It&amp;rsquo;s time for us to step up a gear change or two. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for that thought leader, someone who is a champion for best practice in Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery and who has an eye for high-performance systems.
Our business grew rapidly as a startup, it passed through the scale-up phase, and now we are a large multinational business that&amp;rsquo;s still rapidly expanding. The time has come for us to switch from the ad hocery of &amp;ldquo;start-up mode&amp;rdquo; to a company that&amp;rsquo;s grounded itself in the best engineering practices.
A key part of that is the transition to a CI/CD model of delivery and deployment. We&amp;rsquo;re also undertaking a transformation of our back-end systems to JVM-based microservices in a service mesh, building advanced data analytics and ML/AI in Python and deconstructing our legacy PHP systems into React on the front-end and Kotlin on the back. We&amp;rsquo;re investing heavily in our platform, team and future; and our automation framework will be the solid foundation on which we&amp;rsquo;re building everything else.
We currently use a mixture of some automation with Jenkins (back-end) + Selenium (front), though we are not necessarily particularly attached to those. We currently rely upon a heavy utilisation of subject matter domain experts for manually testing, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a scalable solution and our plans for new market offerings&amp;mdash;particularly driven by an internal product incubator and additional country penetration&amp;mdash;mean that we must eliminate this manual component almost entirely. The Technology team will approach this by harnessing automated Quality Assurance across all the components of our architecture, for which the input from the CI/CD perspective will be the most vital part.
The aim is to keep the code in a deployable state at any given time. That&amp;rsquo;s a key enabler for our growth so that we can push dozens of releases to production&amp;mdash;risk-free&amp;mdash;each day. That best-practice Continuous Delivery experience, with the use of cutting-edge technology, will empower our e-commerce organisation to the next level.
This will shift the role of the domain experts from manually testing to verifying that the functional features they had requested meet their expectations and to suggesting how the implemented features could be further enhanced. This enables growth and stimulates iterative product and service innovation. This role will have a huge impact on the organisation.
For the person we are looking for, this will be a &amp;lsquo;dream job&amp;rsquo;: a green fields leadership position to show us exactly how this should be done and support a hundred million Euro business to become a billion Euro one.
You will need:
-- Experience in a workplace that has transitioned through CI and Continuous Deployment to full-blown Continuous Delivery as well
-- Experience with multiple different automation frameworks and the ability to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each
-- A strong affinity for doing things right the first time but, paradoxically, the flexibility to experiment, fail fast and converge on the optimal solution
-- To be a leader who can balance leading and educating the Technology team on best practice, as well as having the stakeholder management skills to understand business drivers and revenue objectives to ensure we stay business deliverable-focused at all times
-- Well-connected into the DevOps community, preferably recognised as a thought leader in this space
We offer the opportunity to fully engage your passion for CI/CD/CD, to work in a great environment of open-minded and creative individuals and a compensation and relocation package that recognises your excellence.Posted On: October 20, 2018 21:36 UTCCategory: IT &amp;amp; Networking &amp;gt; Network &amp;amp; System Administration

    <link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/React-SVG-exporter-for-Illustrator-that-lives-the-browser_%7E01a969c72539a88a5e?source=rss</link>
    <description>I need help to build an awesome export script for Illustrator. Mission is to generate optimized and clean SVG with one click, and show it as a gallery in HTML. For Mac.
1.) Saves out all artboards as SVGs with names. The extension needs one button &amp;amp;quot;Export&amp;amp;quot;.
2.) Batch renames the filenames (Illustrator adds an annoying prefix)
3.) From there the browser opens with a preloader. We optimize SVG code using SVGOMG service.
https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/
https://github.com/svg/svgo/blob/master/docs/how-it-works/en.md
4.) In the same browser window and when done processing, we show a gallery layout in HTML of all the exported SVGs, with buttons to download/show code.
5.) The gallery will have a button to download the whole set.Budget: $300

    <title>Civil Maps is Hiring for freelance consultant - DevOps Engineer - Upwork</title>
    <link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Civil-Maps-Hiring-for-freelance-consultant-DevOps-Engineer_%7E019e79d6f1ec4273af?source=rss</link>
    <description>Hi ,
We are Civil Maps .
Civil Maps, provider of 3D mapping technology for fully autonomous vehicles, has raised a $6.6 million seed funding round from Ford Motor Company, Motus Ventures, Wicklow Capital, StartX Stanford and Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang&amp;rsquo;s AME Cloud Ventures.
Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; mission is to make it possible for fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Levels 4-5) to drive anywhere smoothly and safely. Through artificial intelligence and vehicle-based local processing, Civil Maps converts sensor data into meaningful map information built specifically to direct fully autonomous vehicles. The company will use the seed investment to accelerate product development and deployment with a number of leading automotive companies and technology partners.
Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; artificial intelligence software aggregates raw 3D data from LiDAR (high-resolution laser imaging), camera and other sensors onboard autonomous vehicles and organizes the information into machine-readable maps. The information is vastly more actionable information than today&amp;rsquo;s mapping systems and requires a fraction of the data storage and transmission for existing technologies. Thanks to this light data footprint, Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; spatial information is far less costly to transmit over cellular networks, enabling the company to more easily crowdsource, update and share road data in real time&amp;mdash;a major improvement over the lengthy processes that require human annotation in current use. As a result, the company can quickly generate and maintain maps that give fully autonomous vehicles the comprehensive and precise knowledge to autonomous operate safely and smoothly on all roads.
About the Opportunity : 
This is an opportunity to work on some of the most exciting problems in the autonomous vehicle industry. Civil Maps is looking for a Devops engineer to grow its overall infrastructure. You will be interacting with a completely custom-made distributed computing framework, handling terabytes and petabytes of machine vision data, and millions of requests from robotic platforms.
In our interdisciplinary teams, you will get acquainted with the many facets of 3D map creation: data collection, geospatial registration, feature extraction, auditing.
Come work on novel challenges, learn and grow while helping Civil Maps achieve on-demand perception of the world around us.
We are hiring the professionals for the below skills:
Work Location&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;: Hyderabad
