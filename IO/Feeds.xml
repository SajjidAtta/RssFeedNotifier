    <title>Need Help Configuring Command Line For Batch Processing URLs To PDFs Using Open Source wkhtmltopdf - Upwork</title>
    <description>I&amp;#039;m looking for a knowledgeable person who can help me use the free open-source software called wkhtmltopdf which is a command line HTML to PDF tool. Here is their website https://wkhtmltopdf.org (there&amp;#039;s a link on their homepage which provides the manual for using the software). I know how to install the software on my computer, but I don&amp;#039;t know how to use it for my specific need as I&amp;#039;m not a computer programmer. 
Essentially, I have a text file on my Windows 10 desktop computer called Websites.txt which has several website URLs (one on each line). The file path on my computer is C:\Windows\Websites.txt. I want to use wkhtmltopdf via command line to read each url in my text file and convert to separate PDF files (one url equals one PDF file). I want the PDF files to be saved in a folder named &amp;amp;quot;URLs to PDFs&amp;amp;quot; with the following folder path C:\Users\micha\Downloads\URLs to PDFs. As for saving each PDF file, I want to save each file using its corresponding URL. For example, the url https://www.google.com would be saved as https___www.google.com.pdf thus replacing the &amp;amp;quot;://&amp;amp;quot; with an &amp;amp;quot;___&amp;amp;quot;. If this is not possible then save as close as possible to the corresponding URL so I can recognize which PDF file belongs to which website URL.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
As for the other settings. I want the full page of each URL to be captured to PDF. I want the PDF file to be searchable. I want everything to work as fast as possible. Speed is important to me because I plan to eventually convert thousands of URLs to PDFs using this tool. As for quality, I want the PDFs to look as best as possible to their corresponding URL in terms of page structure, but I don&amp;#039;t need the graphics to retain high resolution. Graphics/images looking a little pixelated is fine. As long as I can look at each PDF file and read/search through the text and recognize all the images/background graphics I&amp;#039;m satisfied. This means I want the settings to maximize saving space for each PDF file while retaining the structure of each URL website (this should help lower bandwidth use and also help speed up everything I think). I&amp;#039;m not sure what those ideal settings are which is why I want you to use the test sample of 100 website URLs I&amp;#039;ve provided in this project to play around with the different settings to come up with the best settings for my needs (the 100 URL samples are included in this project in the Websites.txt file). Some of the URLs I&amp;#039;ve provided in the test sample do not work, but I&amp;#039;ve done this on purpose because I want to make sure wkhtmltopdf can handle all sorts of different scenarios so that later when I process thousands of URLs I know what to expect. Wkhtmltopdf needs to be able to automate everything including skipping over bad/not working URLs without popups and etc... I don&amp;#039;t want to have to sit by my computer to click on popups just to complete this project. 
I need you to download the free software on your computer to figure out all the best settings for my needs given the information I&amp;#039;ve provided here then write the proper command line so I can just copy and paste it on my computer and follow your instructions in making wkhtmltopdf work for my needs. 
I want to use wkhtmltopdf to complete this project because it&amp;#039;s the best software I&amp;#039;ve discovered during my research, and I&amp;#039;m pretty sure it&amp;#039;s better than anything an individual programmer on Upwork can create for my budget. So I&amp;#039;m not interested in some custom made software program. I simply need help configuring my command line with wkhtmltopdf. 
Once you&amp;#039;ve played around with the different settings and have successful batch processed the test sample file I&amp;#039;ve provided in this project, simply zip the PDF files in a folder and send them to me so I can check the quality and make sure I&amp;#039;m satisfied with your results before accepting your command line code. Also let me know about your experience using the software and how fast it completed the test sample of the 100 URLs I provided. I&amp;#039;ll pay you $20 for your work with helping me configure the proper command line for my project needs. An experienced programmer with command line should have no problem doing this in a little time. I&amp;#039;m in no hurry so this project can be completed within 2-5 days or sooner. Thanks for your help, and I&amp;#039;m looking forward to working with you.Budget: $20

    <title>Simple Inkscape Extension - Upwork</title>
    <description>Hi,
I need a very simple Inkscape extension written.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I process large batches of images with PHP scripts through the Inkscape command line tool.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, the command line tool does not have all of the functionality I require.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have read in forums that I can write an Inkscape extension and will have access to all Inkscape functionality.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is great because I can run these extensions via the command line tool from my existing PHP scripts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This provides an easy workaround for me.
Unfortunately, I&amp;#039;m not a Python programmer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I think if you know Python, you could probably research for an hour on how to complete this task, and have it completed within 2 hours.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Heck, who knows... Maybe you even have experience writing Inkscape extensions...
The required extension functionality:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-select &amp;amp;quot;Relative to: Selection&amp;amp;quot; from the Align and Distribute panel
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-name the extension &amp;amp;quot;Relative to Selection&amp;amp;quot;, place extension in a folder named &amp;amp;quot;HTA&amp;amp;quot; on Inkscape Extension menu.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-make a copy of this 1st extension, and make the selection &amp;amp;quot;Relative to: Page&amp;amp;quot; from the Align and Distribute panel
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-name the extension &amp;amp;quot;Relative to Page&amp;amp;quot;, place extension in a folder named &amp;amp;quot;HTA&amp;amp;quot; on Inkscape Extension menu.

    <title>(JS/React) SVG exporter for Illustrator that lives in the browser - Upwork</title>
    <description>I need help to build an awesome export script for Illustrator. Mission is to generate optimized and clean SVG with one click, and show it as a gallery in HTML. For Mac.
1.) Saves out all artboards as SVGs with names. The extension needs one button &amp;amp;quot;Export&amp;amp;quot;.
2.) Batch renames the filenames (Illustrator adds an annoying prefix)
3.) From there the browser opens with a preloader. We optimize SVG code using SVGOMG service.
https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/
https://github.com/svg/svgo/blob/master/docs/how-it-works/en.md
4.) In the same browser window and when done processing, we show a gallery layout in HTML of all the exported SVGs, with buttons to download/show code.
5.) The gallery will have a button to download the whole set.Budget: $300

    <title>Write and Implement Pervasive SQL query from Guardian Software Database - Upwork</title>
    <description>Looking for an experienced developer in databases, data analysis, and business intelligence.
Our ERP system, Guardian (guardiansoft.com) uses PSQL for their database solution.
They capture all of the data we need but they don&amp;#039;t have a simple report we need built into the system.
We need someone to create the SQL call, implement it into our system and supply instructions and workflow to print the report.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Attached is an example of the report we would like created from the database.
A description of the attached is below:
Attached is a report that would give us a snapshot overview of our employees output through the day. Most of these metrics are already existing in the system, the new one is &amp;ldquo;Efficient Minutes&amp;rdquo;. This metric can be calculated by:
If Guardian stores Labor Efficiency as a percentage (i.e. 60% = .600):
(Efficient Minutes) = (Direct Run Hours)*(Labor Efficiency)*60
If Guardian stores Labor Efficiency as a number (i.e. 60% = 60.0):
(Efficient Minutes) = (Direct Run Hours)*(Labor Efficiency)*60/100
A few additional items:
1)	I would like to see this report segregated by department, but I do not want to see it segregated by individual employee. Regardless of how many days the report covers, I would like to see each employee listed multiple times in the same report, one listing for each day. So the report would be segregated by department, then sorted by employee first, labor date second. If we had a report printed for 5 employees for the week, there would be 25 lines of data, each employee listed 5 times.
2)	I do not want to see totals at the bottom, I want to see averages for the department.
3)	I want the spacing between rows to be larger than it is on the current reports. The spacing on the sample is far easier to read than the reports we are printing off of Guardian right now.Posted On: September 24, 2018 18:12 UTCCategory: Data Science &amp;amp; Analytics &amp;gt; Data Extraction / ETL

    <title>PowerBI report building, consulting, and training - Upwork</title>
    <description>Hi there, 
We&amp;#039;re a medium sized organization and have been on Dynamics NAV (desktop-2015) for about 2 years now. We are looking to improve our reporting processes from manual excel reporting and import from our data sources. This will be a combination of traditional and standard financial reports (such as P&amp;amp;amp;L) as well as a few custom dashboards for our unique business and industry. 
Our reports will need to combine three datawarehouses:
Dynamics NAV -2015 Desktop version, however cloud hosted with SAASPLAZA with a dedicated SQL server (VM). -For Revenue and A/R
ADP Workforce now for Labor cost
Quickbooks Enterprise Desktop - For Accounts Payable. 
We&amp;#039;d like to work with our technology and finance departments to get this project going. We are leaning toward PowerBI while still a newer platform to keep our vendors as close to the Microsoft Ecosystem as possible. The only other vendor we are considering at this time is Tableau. Our Finance Director looking to complete this project is also leaning towards PowerBI because they are already familar with advanced Queries using Excel.Posted On: September 24, 2018 18:12 UTCCategory: Design &amp;amp; Creative &amp;gt; Other - Design &amp;amp; Creative

    <title>Build a Web App - Data Retrieval - Upwork</title>
    <description>I need a webapp that provides a user with some options detailing data to be queried.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When the query is completed, it runs a query on an AWS RDS database and loads the results as a CSV.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;An example would be:
User wants a list of all records of people over the age of 65 and who participated in event A, but not event B.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Currently, we have a database schema that is adequate for the queries that will be run, however we are open to the idea of modification in order to improve performance, but not as a part of this scope.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The webapp will be deployed on AWS.
Right now, this project is in proof-of-concept stage, so aesthetics are not important (speed of development/deployment is VERY important!), however, once the POC is complete, we will enter into a ~3-month long development cycle for an initial launch where we will develop more in-depth use cases.
With your proposal, please list any examples of data-intensive apps deployed on AWS that you have worked with.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Additionally, please provide your preferred tech stack for developing this POC rapidly.Budget: $750

    <title>Batch program for Whitepages API - Upwork</title>
    <description>I need a simple windows based program which will loop through a list with names/city/state and for each entry make a REST API call to the whitepages API.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The program should take the JSON based responses and format them to return address for each input entry and then export the list of responses to a spreadsheet.
This can be done either with excel, VB, or any other technology which makes sense.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;m looking for something very simple to perform only this one function.
Here&amp;#039;s a link to a thread on excel forum which contains an example spreadsheet that sort of does what is needed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;m looking for something slightly more reliable and possibly faster.
http://www.excelforum.com/excel-programming-vba-macros/788072-loop-to-do-whitepages-api-calls.html
I also have a windows program that I can provide which provides an example of what is needed but no longer works perfectly after whitepages has changed the order of their response fields.Budget: $500

    <title>Simple modification of a batch file - Upwork</title>
    <description>I want to modify an existing batch file which will open a random file from a folder. Any of the scripts on this page will work for this project:
https://superuser.com/questions/872048/opening-random-file-from-folder-and-subfolders-with-batch-script-windows-7
So what this script should be able to do is open two files. When it selects the first file, it should be able to save the name of the file and be able to open another corresponding folder with the same name in another folder. For example:
First file: C:\Users\(name)\Documents\My Games - choose file and save name
Second file: C:\Users\(name)\Documents\My Saves\(saved file name)\ - choose file

    <title>Google stack app to help doctors in Africa - Upwork</title>
    <description>A developer has created a Windows (tablet) based standalone C# .NET prototype application to collect patient data in hospitals in Africa. The prototype has the following functionality:
1. Simple use case: 
- A patient walks into a mobile hospital and lays his finger on the scanner. 
- If he has not visited one of the mobile hospitals before, he will be asked for personalia, like name, birth date, medical history and a picture is taken with the webcam and his fingerprints are scanned and stored in the local database. 
- If he has visited one of the mobile hospitals before his record will show up + previous session. The GPS sensor is used to also store the current location. 
- The doctor/nurse fills takes his temperature, blood pressure and fills out the session form, which is also stored in the local database. 
- When the doctor/nurse returns in the evening or by the end of the week back to the city the laptop/tablet will be connected with the Internet and the local database is synced with the central database. Also the changes from other mobile hospitals are copied to the local database. 
- The dashboard which contains anonymized patient data on an aggregated level is updated after each sync request. 
2. Is able to work function in offline circumstance and when there is a connection to the Internet available (typical a few times per month), the data is synced with a central server. Also it should behalf good on unstable internet connections. 
3. Uses a fingerprint external hardware device (e.g. TWAIN) to identify patients. We have two Futronic fingerprint devices (http://www.futronic-tech.com/download.html) which function well with the prototype, but another brand external fingerprint device which has a better API could also be used. If possible, we would like to have a general solution in which we do not depend on a single finger print scanner brand and its API. 
4. Supports different platforms (at least Android, but preferable also iOs and browser based versions which would work on any device which is able to open a browser). 
5. Proposed simplified database structure,:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- one mobile hospital (also called firm) holds many patients
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- one patients holds many sessions (=visits to the doctor)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- one firm holds many users (which need credentials to sign in)
6. A dashboard with anonymized data should also be created. See for example this URL(http://132.148.245.146/test.html). This URL is dynamically connected with the SQL Server database to which the prototype C# app pushes the the collected dummy data. 
I would like to ask to do the following:
A. Create (web)app with the same functionality as the prototype using Google libraries. And with some additional features:
- possibility to export a patient record and its sessions to PDF. 
- has a more professional and user friendly user interface, for example easily browse through previous sessions and see whatat field have changed. 
- stores fingerprint and webcam images in an efficient way. We would like to store data for 500,000 patients on a 128GB microSD card and if we will have more patients in the future we might want to us an extrnal device to store data. Also the lookup by fingerprint should work efficient in a large patient database. 
- new fields will be added. 
B. Create back end which is hosted in the Google Cloud 
C. Create dashboard to get overview of aggregated data like the URL below. 
We would like to use platforms created/maintained by Google. We would think of:
- IndexedDB &amp;amp;amp; Service Worker: https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/live-data-in-the-service-worker
- native promises: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises
- node.js webserver: https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/why-the-hell-would-you-use-node-js-4b053b94ab8e
- flutter: https://www.udacity.com/course/build-native-mobile-apps-with-flutter--ud905 
- google big query: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/
- google data studio: https://www.google.com/analytics/data-studio/
And for the scanner drives, this approach might be helpful: https://asprise.com/document-scan-upload-image-browser/direct-to-server-php-asp.net-overview.html
I attached screenshots of the app. 
I would like to use upwork tools for automatic time registration (including screen capturing while you work for me), let me know if that is a problem for you.Posted On: September 24, 2018 18:12 UTCCategory: Web, Mobile &amp;amp; Software Dev &amp;gt; Desktop Software Development

    <title>Looking for strong Nodejs/API and Angular5x  Developers â€“ Agency Preferred - Upwork</title>
    <description>We are looking to establish a long term relationship with an Upwork Agency and hire 1-2 members as dedicated resources. We do not require a Project Manager for day to day activities and are happy to communicate directly with the developers, however we would like to know there is a manager available for escalations and oversight. We would ask that a standard start time be maintained so we can schedule some overlap (we prefer morning hours of CST timezone) to review work and discuss tasks.
**Your Responsibilities Will Include:
-	development, migration and updates to a large content management system that manages a lot of retail and mall content
-	work collaboratively in Slack together as a group. Your team will interface with myself, our project managers, and our development team on a regular basis and the ability to quickly respond in chat is very important
-	have regular starting hours with some overlap of CST timezone and consistently starting work at that time
-	tracking your time per task with notes for our records
Our goal is that you will be a part of our team and we will work together on this cool platform and others for months and years to come.
** About the CMS System:
You will be working purely on the data side of the CMS and not the front-end website. We inject data from a few sources, we expose APIs and webservices to other systems which consume our data either for processing or sending to the other system which manages the actual website and mobile application. We have about 2 months of work in our backlog and we would like to bring on skilled professionals to work with us on getting this stuff done. As part of the onboarding and development we will be working on documentation and diagramming the system. We feel that having new developers work on this will also help them learn the system and how it works so that when they develop on it, it will make sense to them.
** Technologies You Should be Familiar With:
We have put together a list of specific skills that would be involved in our application and for the new team members to be responsible for. It&amp;#039;s not critical that you are 100% experts at all the areas listed below but you need to be proficient in larger applications built in a MEAN stack which utilize a lot of AWS services.

    <title>Male Mandarin voice talent -30 - 40 lessons.  Each lesson approx. 1500 words. - Upwork</title>
    <description>Hello, we are rolling out 30 to 40 lessons, which are approximately 1500-1600 words over the next three to five months. These will be in batches of 10 lessons at a time for the same male Mandarin talent to record. We will use the same voice for all 30 to 40 lessons.
The main priority is pacing and delivery of the script. Since there are technical terms in the lessons, its important to have subtle and purposeful pauses throughout in order for the listener to digest/ grasp the information.
The tonality of the voice is to be a blend of conversational and informative and educational. Not too dull, dry and robotic. Not guy next store delivery the whole time. Moderate inflection with a smooth fluid delivery. Personable yet intelligent.
Pay will be $150 for each lesson and if the lesson goes over 2000 words (which if it were to go over it would not be by very much ) I will pay $250. Ideal delivery time for the 10 lessons would be about 10 to 14 days, but I have some leeway if its needed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As i&amp;#039;m sure you&amp;#039;ve all experienced, &amp;amp;quot;the sooner the better&amp;amp;quot;.
Requirements to be a candidate:
1). Provide a sample or two from the script attached. Feel free to provide different deliveries if you wish (not trying to make more work for you but want everyone to have a fair shot)
2) Be available over the next couple months for all of the lessons
3) Have a home studio that you&amp;#039;re able to deliver with high quality
4) Willing to discuss delivery time to meet time requirements. I would say approximately 10-14 days would be a solid window.
I appreciate and respect your willingness to audition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;m not asking you to record the whole document, just a two or three sections to showcase tonality, pacing, delivery.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Thank you -- Mark
PS - the short script doesn&amp;#039;t seem to come out in the format that allows you to see the spaces between the paragraphs. Use your discernment and feel free to include ample pausesBudget: $6,000

    <title>Need a Powershell expert who can create PS scripts in batch file to automate Dynamics CRM 2011 to Dynamics CRM 2016 Upgrade tasks - Upwork</title>
    <description>This runs like a well oiled machine for us. We get these customer databases and we do the same thing every time. No errors, nothing. But it takes 10 hours. 
We have the list of steps. This is for our own environment,
At a very high level these are the tasks:
1. Restore the Client database to a server with Pre-installed CRM 2011
2. Run a sql script to clean the db
3. Import the Organization
4. Back up the DB
5. Run another SQL script
6. Back up the CRM 2013 upgraded DB
7. Restore to another server with CRM 2015 installed already
8. Import Org
9. Run a script
10. Back up the db
11. Restore to another CRM 2016 already installed
12. Import Org
Run another SQL script.
Done.
When we do this on client servers, there are some variations.
For every new installation or deployment of software, we have to do many system checks and verifications on their Windows Servers
Lets define the scope of work. 
Do the low hanging fruits first. 
Lets make it a phased approach. 
Automation of these frequently repetitive tasks with every client will save us a lot of time in deployments and will make us more productive. I have been working on some of these on my own but a powershell expert would be good to work with.

    <title>Civil Maps is Hiring for freelance consultant - DevOps Engineer - Upwork</title>
    <description>Hi ,
We are Civil Maps .
Civil Maps, provider of 3D mapping technology for fully autonomous vehicles, has raised a $6.6 million seed funding round from Ford Motor Company, Motus Ventures, Wicklow Capital, StartX Stanford and Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang&amp;rsquo;s AME Cloud Ventures.
Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; mission is to make it possible for fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Levels 4-5) to drive anywhere smoothly and safely. Through artificial intelligence and vehicle-based local processing, Civil Maps converts sensor data into meaningful map information built specifically to direct fully autonomous vehicles. The company will use the seed investment to accelerate product development and deployment with a number of leading automotive companies and technology partners.
Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; artificial intelligence software aggregates raw 3D data from LiDAR (high-resolution laser imaging), camera and other sensors onboard autonomous vehicles and organizes the information into machine-readable maps. The information is vastly more actionable information than today&amp;rsquo;s mapping systems and requires a fraction of the data storage and transmission for existing technologies. Thanks to this light data footprint, Civil Maps&amp;rsquo; spatial information is far less costly to transmit over cellular networks, enabling the company to more easily crowdsource, update and share road data in real time&amp;mdash;a major improvement over the lengthy processes that require human annotation in current use. As a result, the company can quickly generate and maintain maps that give fully autonomous vehicles the comprehensive and precise knowledge to autonomous operate safely and smoothly on all roads.
About the Opportunity : 
This is an opportunity to work on some of the most exciting problems in the autonomous vehicle industry. Civil Maps is looking for a Devops engineer to grow its overall infrastructure. You will be interacting with a completely custom-made distributed computing framework, handling terabytes and petabytes of machine vision data, and millions of requests from robotic platforms.
In our interdisciplinary teams, you will get acquainted with the many facets of 3D map creation: data collection, geospatial registration, feature extraction, auditing.
Come work on novel challenges, learn and grow while helping Civil Maps achieve on-demand perception of the world around us.
